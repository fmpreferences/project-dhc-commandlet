# project-dhc-commandlet
## What is this?
This is Project DHC, a project to download all videos from a channel (dhc stands for "download hole channel", yes "hole", dwc doesn'r roll of the tongue), a command line project I made when I was a kid, but updated and I (plan to) add slightly more features. 
There are probably more usable things than this so I encourage you to use anything else before resorting to this.
